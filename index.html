                <h4>Albert Einstein ( March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.</h4>
                <h4>His mass – energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics”, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.</h4>

                <li>
                    <span>1889 - </span>Settles into a program of self-education at age 10 and begins reading as much about science as he can.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>1896 - </span>Graduates from high school at age 17 and enrolls at the ETH (the Federal Polytechnic School) in Zurich.

                    <span>1901 - </span>Becomes a Swiss citizen and, unemployed, searches for work. Meets Maric in northern Italy for a tryst, and she becomes pregnant. In the fall, he finds work in Schaffhausen, Switzerland as a tutor. Maric, visibly pregnant, moves to Stein am Rhein, three miles upriver. She then returns to her parents' home to give birth to her child. Einstein moves to Bern.
